\subsection{What are the outputs of GAMER-pipeline?}

GO annotations from GAMER-pipeline will be presented in Go Annotation
2.0 Format (GAF). All the annotations from different methods will
converted to GAF format files and will be saved in sub folders in the
gaf directory. The sub-directory structure in gaf is as follows -
mixed-method (Raw output from mixed-method piplines) - raw (Raw output
from Sequence-similarity and Domain-presence based methods, mixed-method
output filtered to exclude low quality annotations from mixed-method
pipelines) - uniq (Unique annotations from each tool cleaned by removing
duplicate annotations from the raw annotation files) - non\_red
(Non-redundant annotations filtered by removing ancestral GO terms from
the unique annotation files) - agg (Final aggregate dataset created by
combining annotations from all 6 Non-redundant annotation datasets)
