\section{Running GO-MAP}

GO-MAP is run in two distinct steps. Step one is to run pipeline1.py script to run sequence-similarity methods, domain-based methods and some mixed-method pipelines. Second step is to run pipleine2.py which combines outputs from different tools and creates the aggregate GO annotation dataset.

Note: GO-MAP pipeline can be run on multiple input fasta files from the same location, but each input file has to have a different config file.
